<h1>Review of tools and technology used in this project</h1>
</div>
<h2>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2> 

<p>I’m very happy with the Visual Studio Code. Before starting to build the website I asked if it would be ok to other another IDE (integrated development environment) and while the answer was yes, based on my own research VSC is the best all-around solution for actually understanding the code involved rather than just making the website for you using a graphical user interface.</p>

<p>VSC in particular is extremely versatile with the ability to change programming languages on the fly, extensions from its own appstore, easy integration with github it truly stands out amongst the crowed and last but not least, the quality of life changes that make typing code much quicker. </p>

<p>Trello has been somewhat useful but as I mentioned before I don’t consider it that great of a tool for a solo project of this scale. I can certainly see the use for larger solo projects but for the sake of building a basic website it’s not needed for me. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h2> 

<p>As mentioned above Visual Studio Code was the best and most appropriate choice to get to grips with html and CSS. Trello, at least for my particular use case, not so much. </p>

<h2>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2> 

<p>I feel that my project was a good first step in learning some of the fundamentals of html however it is very much a basic website that exposes my lack of knowledge on the subject. If I had around a month before making the website I would have spent a lot more time researching what the various tags and other things of a coding nature do so I could make a more appealing website.</p>

<p>If I were given the time over again I would give greater forethought into the layout to better present the information now that I know everything that would be going into the website.</p>

<div>
<h2>Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2> 
<p>Cleaning up of the code so that when I learn new techniques I’ll be able to implement them quicker than digging through a jumble of messy html code.</p>

<p>Making the website more appealing to the eye with a better style system via CSS.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
So far I feel that the deployed systems, tools and implementation of them has been fit for my purpose of making a basic website. Naturally, as I learn more this will only improve with time!
</div>
<div>
<h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2> 

<p>In general I feel that for such a small scale project as this that it doesn’t warrant bringing in additional people on the team as the time lag between vision, comprehension and finally execution of the vision could outweigh the benefit additional people would bring. </p>

<p>If I were to do it in a team I would use the Kanban <a href="#one">[1]</a> method with Trello  which would increase the chances of a quicker and clearer execution of my vision for the website. Further expanding on this I would delegate research, coding, co-ordination between different people so what would take me 10 hours alone would be done in 2-3 hours. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>

<p>For myself as an individual: I would do more research into coding shortcuts and general useable knowledge when it comes to coding. Perhaps with slightly more focus on the Kanban method and Trello.
For a team based answer: Trello and Slack are great tools to use to increase productivity and efficiency however there are other tools that you can use such as stand-ups with the whole team that help to keep everyone up-to-date on the latest progress with each team member. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2> 

<p> There isn’t a need for Slack with a project like this when it’s for and by myself since I can make all the decisions on the fly without wasting any time seeking the approval of others. The biggest solution that I’ve taken away from this project is that I need to do more research on effective html coding before putting into practice what I’ve learned.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>

<p>It would all depend on the scope and nature of the project in-question but generally when someone wants to test it all boils down to reducing the “risk” of development. Risk for me would be defined as time, effort and money! Generally ensuring best practices are followed in Visual Code Studio it should be more than enough to get a minimal viable product out.</p>

<p> As I was writing code I would test it with the appropriate options such as console.log for javascript or simply saving html changes in Visual Code Studio and then refreshing the .html file in my website browser.</p>
