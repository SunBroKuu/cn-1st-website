<h1>Review of tools and technology used in this project</h1>
</div>
<div>
    <h3> 1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p class="custom">I firmly believe the role of IT in the modern business place is to streamline things and open up new opportunities that otherwise wouldn’t be present to the companies that invest in the sector. There are certain sectors such as security that have been drastically enhanced by intelligent applications and hardware that make securing the things they need to much easier.
    
    <div>
    <p class="custom">The bottom line is that time is money and the more a company invests in efficient design of their IT system the more time and money will be saved later down the line. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully, What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
    <p class="custom">I would like to preface this first though by saying without knowing more specific project/goal demands it’s hard to go over just what would be the best method and toolset to finish the projects.</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Trello: Is a great service that makes it easy for teams of varying sizes to organise the varying tasks that are needed to make a project come together. <a href="#suresure1">[1]</a> A popular style of using Trello is the “kanban” method which is described in greater detail here: https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/what-is-kanban </p>
    
    <p class="custom">Slack: This is a nice service that enables rapid communication with project members with a work focused setup. There are varying apps that can be added to Slack which enable greater productivity such as the Trello app that allows people to add cards directly from Slack without leaving the application. As you can imagine this is a massive time saver! <a href="#suresure2">[2]</a></p>
    
    <p class="custom">Beyond the two tools I’ve mentioned I would say that a willingness to help others without micromanaging while leaving egos aside is essential for making a productive and happy team. Covering each other in parts the others have difficulty with is very important and it’s my firm belief that the hiring process should focus a lot more on how individual personalities and temperaments gel together rather than the direct coding skills of a person and these can be taught if the person has the desire and will. </p>
    
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3> 1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
    <p class="custom">I’m planning to use an ad-hoc method with basic reminders on Trello for what I need to do for the website. Since I’m the only person working on this project I don’t envisage the need for highly detailed cards that would otherwise enable smooth progress of the project with 2 or more people. </p>
    
    <p class="custom">Trello link - <a href="https://trello.com/b/1Ab0CpL6/website-project-anthony">https://trello.com/b/1Ab0CpL6/website-project-anthony</a>  </p>

    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/QlaVP8N.png" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="100%" height="500%">
    
    <p class="custom">Here you can see I’ve put out the foundation of the website in with a focus being on the written content. This will be updated with more steps as I learn the html and CSS needed to make the website look good and not bad "AF". </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2>
    <p class="custom">There are several risks that we could go into but let's focus on a security point of view and a time/money focus.</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Security: Having an all digital protect could be dangerous due to malicious 3rd parties that are attempting to breach the defences to steal source code or other copyrighted material for their own ends.</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Time & Money: The biggest cause for projects to fail is due to the lack of proper oversight and planning for unforeseen eventualities like extend time to implement parts of the project. Luckily with tools like Trello this shouldn’t happen all that often with proper management! Sadly there is a very high number of digital projects that fail for the reasons mentioned above as well as some others which you can read about here: https://enginess.io/insights/why-digital-projects-fail </p>
    
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <h3>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software How do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
    <p class="custom">If I were the project lead I would first of all consult some of my peers that work as both frontend and backend developers to see what their opinions are on emerging tech. I’m very fortunate that some members of my Twitch community have been working as paid front/back end developers for a number of years. In addition to this peer research I would search on the Internet to see if there was anything that caught my eye and if their was I would email the company behind the tool to enquire about it further.</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Once I’ve had a few languages and tools together I would do some very small user testing before going back to the drawing board based on how well we can get the tools to function with their needs and the overall project needs in mind. </p>
    
    <h3>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h2>
    <p class="custom">Html, CSS and javascript are deeply intertwined with website development to the point where it’s hard to have a good looking website without all of those elements working together properly. Html <a href="#suresure3">[3]</a> is primarily responsible for the coding of the website where as CSS <a href="#suresure4">[4]</a> is more focused on the graphical appearance of the website EG making an image change aspect ratio and more. Finally, there is javascript <a href="#suresure5">[5]</a> which can be used for number of things EG detecting the use of an adblocker running which could that force the user to disable it before using the website.</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Trello I’ve found has been largely redundant for me as I tend to keep things in mind but overall I see it as a useful tool when there are more than one person working on a project. I’ve mostly used it to remind me of what work I need to when finishing for the day!</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Git and Github are very useful tools to push the code I’ve been working on to the cloud so that I can work on it from any machine. This also works as a good redundancy measure to protect against hardware failure and accidental loss of code providing best practice is in place!</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
    <h3>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
    <p class="custom">I don’t consider myself a legal expert so I would much rather refer you to check out how Europe’s new GDPR affects digital projects going forward <a href="#suresure6">[6]</a> However, what I will say is that due to how draconian the EU’s copyright and new GDPR laws are is it’s preventing some website use EG www.dicks.com. In addition to that is article 13 which has the potential to stifle content creators such as much so overall I have a very low opinion of the politics involved with this which is why I encourage you to seek out an unbiased opinion.</p>
    
    </div>

<h3>2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</3> 

<p class="custom">I’m very happy with the Visual Studio Code. Before starting to build the website I asked if it would be ok to other another IDE (integrated development environment) and while the answer was yes, based on my own research VSC is the best all-around solution for actually understanding the code involved rather than just making the website for you using a graphical user interface.</p>

<p class="custom">VSC in particular is extremely versatile with the ability to change programming languages on the fly, extensions from its own appstore, easy integration with github it truly stands out amongst the crowed and last but not least, the quality of life changes that make typing code much quicker. </p>

<p class="custom">Trello has been somewhat useful but as I mentioned before I don’t consider it that great of a tool for a solo project of this scale. I can certainly see the use for larger solo projects but for the sake of building a basic website it’s not needed for me. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</h3> 

<p class="custom">As mentioned above Visual Studio Code was the best and most appropriate choice to get to grips with html and CSS. Trello, at least for my particular use case, not so much. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3> 

<p class="custom">I feel that my project was a good first step in learning some of the fundamentals of html however it is very much a basic website that exposes my lack of knowledge on the subject. If I had around a month before making the website I would have spent a lot more time researching what the various tags and other things of a coding nature do so I could make a more appealing website.</p>

<p class="custom">If I were given the time over again I would give greater forethought into the layout to better present the information now that I know everything that would be going into the website.</p> 
</div>
<div>
<h3>2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3> 
<p class="custom">Cleaning up of the code so that when I learn new techniques I’ll be able to implement them quicker than digging through a jumble of messy html code.</p>

<p class="custom">Making the website more appealing to the eye with a better style system via CSS.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h3>
<p class="custom">So far I feel that the deployed systems, tools and implementation of them has been fit for my purpose of making a basic website. Naturally, as I learn more this will only improve with time! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3> 

<p class="custom">In general I feel that for such a small scale project as this that it doesn’t warrant bringing in additional people on the team as the time lag between vision, comprehension and finally execution of the vision could outweigh the benefit additional people would bring. </p>

<p class="custom">If I were to do it in a team I would use the Kanban <a href="#one">[7]</a> method with Trello  which would increase the chances of a quicker and clearer execution of my vision for the website. Further expanding on this I would delegate research, coding, co-ordination between different people so what would take me 10 hours alone would be done in 2-3 hours. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>

<p class="custom">For myself as an individual: I would do more research into coding shortcuts and general useable knowledge when it comes to coding. Perhaps with slightly more focus on the Kanban method and Trello.
For a team based answer: Trello and Slack are great tools to use to increase productivity and efficiency however there are other tools that you can use such as stand-ups with the whole team that help to keep everyone up-to-date on the latest progress with each team member. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3> 

<p class="custom"> There isn’t a need for Slack with a project like this when it’s for and by myself since I can make all the decisions on the fly without wasting any time seeking the approval of others. The biggest solution that I’ve taken away from this project is that I need to do more research on effective html coding before putting into practice what I’ve learned.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>

<p class="custom">It would all depend on the scope and nature of the project in-question but generally when someone wants to test it all boils down to reducing the “risk” of development. Risk for me would be defined as time, effort and money! Generally ensuring best practices are followed in Visual Code Studio it should be more than enough to get a minimal viable product out.</p>

<p class="custom"> As I was writing code I would test it with the appropriate options such as console.log for javascript or simply saving html changes in Visual Code Studio and then refreshing the .html file in my website browser.</p>
