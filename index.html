<h2>About Me</h2>

    <h3>Who is Anthony?</h3>
    <p class="custom">My name is Anthony Chambers and I’ve always had a technological background when it comes to IT going back to when I got my very first PC which, by modern standards at least, was a dinosaur with an AMD K6-2 500 Mhz based PC! In my spare time I’m a partnered Twitch (Twitch is a live streaming service where people watch others on the Internet) streamer and this has challenged me from both a creative and technical standpoint to overcome the challenges I have to reach the vaunted milestone that is partnership with not only Twitch but intertwined services Discord and Streamlabs. As an example of Twitch here are two of my "emotes" which is a form of art that people use to express differing emotions depending on the moment that happens to take place on the stream. <a href="#suresure">[1]</a> </p>

    <p class="custom">Aside from the above, I’ve always been proficient with the hardware side of the PC world I’ve always felt a bit intimidated by coding due to how complex it seemed which compounded my own perceived weaknesses with mathematics. It’s because of this that I decided to challenge myself which is when I found Code Nation and their coding course.</p>
    
    <h3>The Code Nation journey so far!</h3>
    <p class="custom">My experience so far has been a very pleasant with the staff Ezra, Liam, Leona and Adam (to name but a few!) have been very supportive of me with this drastic life change. I don’t know where this journey will end but I know that it’ll be due to Code Nation that I can once again be proud of myself. </p>
