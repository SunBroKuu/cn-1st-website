    <h3>Who is Anthony?</h3>
    <p class="custom">My name is Anthony Chambers and I’ve always had a technological background when it comes to IT going back to when I got my very first PC which, by modern standards at least, was a dinosaur with an AMD K6-2 500 Mhz based PC! In my spare time I’m a partnered Twitch (Twitch is a live streaming service where people watch others on the Internet) streamer and this has challenged me from both a creative and technical standpoint to overcome the challenges I have to reach the vaunted milestone that is partnership with not only Twitch but intertwined services Discord and Streamlabs. As an example of Twitch here are two of my "emotes" which is a form of art that people use to express differing emotions depending on the moment that happens to take place on the stream. <a href="#suresure">[1]</a> </p>

    <p class="custom">Aside from the above, I’ve always been proficient with the hardware side of the PC world I’ve always felt a bit intimidated by coding due to how complex it seemed which compounded my own perceived weaknesses with mathematics. It’s because of this that I decided to challenge myself which is when I found Code Nation and their coding course and I'm glad that I did find it because I can feel this is the life change that (while being extremely hard for me!) I was meant to do all along. When I'm not streaming on Twitch or doing something for my community I'm not typically studying various different programming languages. My current focuses are javascript and c# but I do eventually want to at least have a good grasp on all languages so I can pick the right tool for the job!</p>
    
    <h3>The Code Nation journey so far!</h3>
    <p class="custom">My experience so far has been a very pleasant with the staff Ezra, Liam, Leona and Adam (to name but a few!) have been very supportive of me with this drastic life change. I don’t know where this journey will end but I know that it’ll be due to Code Nation that I can once again be proud of myself and make my late gran (who was my mother effectively) even more proud of me than she already was. </p>

    <p>Luckily I've been given the chance to go on Code Nation's Cyber Security course on 08/07/19 and I can't wait to add this feather to my cap. Ultimately I would like to end up working as a frontend developer but this could all change. I recently was able to attend a company recruitment talk by Corporation pop Pop and the life changing work their doing in the medical field with xploro for children is mind blowingly important and something that makes me want to strive to be better as a junior developer.</p>
