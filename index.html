<h2>About Me</h2>
<body>
    <div>
    <h3>Personal background</h3>
    <p>My name is Anthony Chambers and I’ve always had a technological background when it comes to IT going back to when I got my very first PC which, by modern standards at least, was a dinosaur with an AMD K6-2 500 Mhz based PC! In my spare time I’m a partnered Twitch (Twitch is a live streaming service where people watch others on the Internet) streamer and this has challenged me from both a creative and technical standpoint to overcome the challenges I have to reach the vaunted milestone that is partnership with not only Twitch but intertwined services Discord and Streamlabs. As an example of Twitch here are two of my "emotes" which is a form of art that people use to express differing emotions depending on the moment that happens to take place on the stream. <a href="#suresure">[1]</a> </p>

    <p>Aside from the above, I’ve always been proficient with the hardware side of the PC world I’ve always felt a bit intimidated by coding due to how complex it seemed which compounded my own perceived weaknesses with mathematics. It’s because of this that I decided to challenge myself which is when I found Code Nation and their coding course.</p>
    
    <h3>The Code Nation journey so far!</h3>
    My experience so far has been a very pleasant with the staff Ezra, Liam, Leona and Adam (to name but a few!) have been very supportive of me with this drastic life change. I don’t know where this journey will end but I know that it’ll be due to Code Nation that I can once again be proud of myself.

<h2> Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
<p>I firmly believe the role of IT in the modern business place is to streamline things and open up new opportunities that otherwise wouldn’t be present to the companies that invest in the sector. There are certain sectors such as security that have been drastically enhanced by intelligent applications and hardware that make securing the things they need to much easier.</p>

The bottom line is that time is money and the more a company invests in efficient design of their IT system the more time and money will be saved later down the line.

<h2>Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully, What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
<p>I would like to preface this first though by saying without knowing more specific project/goal demands it’s hard to go over just what would be the best method and toolset to finish the projects.</p>

<p>Trello: Is a great service that makes it easy for teams of varying sizes to organise the varying tasks that are needed to make a project come together. <a href="#suresure1">[2]</a> A popular style of using Trello is the “kanban” method which is described in greater detail here: https://resources.collab.net/agile-101/what-is-kanban </p>

<p>Slack: This is a nice service that enables rapid communication with project members with a work focused setup. There are varying apps that can be added to Slack which enable greater productivity such as the Trello app that allows people to add cards directly from Slack without leaving the application. As you can imagine this is a massive time saver! <a href="#suresure2">[3]</a></p>

<p>Beyond the two tools I’ve mentioned I would say that a willingness to help others without micromanaging while leaving egos aside is essential for making a productive and happy team. Covering each other in parts the others have difficulty with is very important and it’s my firm belief that the hiring process should focus a lot more on how individual personalities and temperaments gel together rather than the direct coding skills of a person and these can be taught if the person has the desire and will. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h2> Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
<p>I’m planning to use an ad-hoc method with basic reminders on Trello for what I need to do for the website. Since I’m the only person working on this project I don’t envisage the need for highly detailed cards that would otherwise enable smooth progress of the project with 2 or more people. </p>

<p>Trello link - <a href="https://trello.com/b/1Ab0CpL6/website-project-anthony">https://trello.com/b/1Ab0CpL6/website-project-anthony</a>  </p>

<p>Here you can see I’ve put out the foundation of the website in with a focus being on the written content. This will be updated with more steps as I learn the html and CSS needed to make the website look good and not bad "AF". </p>

<h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2>
<p>There are several risks that we could go into but let's focus on a security point of view and a time/money focus.</p>

<p>Security: Having an all digital protect could be dangerous due to malicious 3rd parties that are attempting to breach the defences to steal source code or other copyrighted material for their own ends.</p>

<p>Time & Money: The biggest cause for projects to fail is due to the lack of proper oversight and planning for unforeseen eventualities like extend time to implement parts of the project. Luckily with tools like Trello this shouldn’t happen all that often with proper management! Sadly there is a very high number of digital projects that fail for the reasons mentioned above as well as some others which you can read about here: https://enginess.io/insights/why-digital-projects-fail </p>

</div>

<div>
<h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software How do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
<p>If I were the project lead I would first of all consult some of my peers that work as both frontend and backend developers to see what their opinions are on emerging tech. I’m very fortunate that some members of my Twitch community have been working as paid front/back end developers for a number of years. In addition to this peer research I would search on the Internet to see if there was anything that caught my eye and if their was I would email the company behind the tool to enquire about it further.</p>

<p>Once I’ve had a few languages and tools together I would do some very small user testing before going back to the drawing board based on how well we can get the tools to function with their needs and the overall project needs in mind. </p>

<h2> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h2>
<p>Html, CSS and javascript are deeply intertwined with website development to the point where it’s hard to have a good looking website without all of those elements working together properly. Html <a href="#suresure3">[4]</a> is primarily responsible for the coding of the website where as CSS <a href="#suresure4">[5]</a> is more focused on the graphical appearance of the website EG making an image change aspect ratio and more. Finally, there is javascript <a href="#suresure5">[6]</a> which can be used for number of things EG detecting the use of an adblocker running which could that force the user to disable it before using the website.</p>

<p>Trello I’ve found has been largely redundant for me as I tend to keep things in mind but overall I see it as a useful tool when there are more than one person working on a project. I’ve mostly used it to remind me of what work I need to when finishing for the day!</p>

<p>Git and Github are very useful tools to push the code I’ve been working on to the cloud so that I can work on it from any machine. This also works as a good redundancy measure to protect against hardware failure and accidental loss of code providing best practice is in place!</p>

<div>
<h2>Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<p>I don’t consider myself a legal expert so I would much rather refer you to check out how Europe’s new GDPR affects digital projects going forward <a href="#suresure6">[7]</a> However, what I will say is that due to how draconian the EU’s copyright and new GDPR laws are is it’s preventing some website use EG www.dicks.com. In addition to that is article 13 which has the potential to stifle content creators such as much so overall I have a very low opinion of the politics involved with this which is why I encourage you to seek out an unbiased opinion.</p>
