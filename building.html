<h2> Describing the content and layout for each page </h2> 
 Index.html is the main landing page of the website which encompasses the basic about me section from unit 1 as well as sources with URL links to the websites to the sources to backup some of points. It also includes a link to the reviews part of the website as per the last part of unit 1. <br>
</div>
<div>    
    <h2> Plan and create your website </h2> 
    This is an in-progress section as I learn about CSS with the aim to publish github pages. The plan for now is a basic section to describe myself and complete the course units. <br>
</div>    
<h2> Selecting and using web site features and structure </h2> 
    I selected a basic layout and feature set to ensure the website was quick to make so I could practice with html in visual code studio. The structure is simplistic with a back button on the review.html. 
<div>    
    <h2> Selecting and using styles to keep your site consistent </h2> 
    I chose a basic CSS style from CSS toolbox to help keep my website consistent and more pleasing to the eye. The other choice was to use html which, being a markup language makes it not ideal for quick an consistent coding.

 <div> 
    <h2> Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2> 
    GDPR, DMCA (General Data Protection Regulation, Digital Millennium Copyright Act) are two very important copyright and data protection schemes that all content creators (like myself with Twitch) should be aware of as it will determine how you can handle customer data like cookies and things of that nature. Some websites such as dicks.com (a baseball/American sporting goods website) outright refuses connections from UK IP addresses. 
<div>    
    <h2> Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h2> 
    
    <p>When talking about disabilities two main issues come to mind; blindness and epilepsy. When it comes to blindness there are certain things that could be taken into account for the degree of the disability such as a colour blind mode, auditory feedback to help the user navigate the website and more. When talking about epilepsy there are two chief things that come to mind that we can do which is first of all warn the user on entry to the website. Finally, having a toggle button that will minimise any flashing effects on the website can help too.</p>
    
    Naturally there are more disabilities and things we, as developers, can do to help mitigate and ensure the Internet is as open and accessible as possible for everyone.

    <h2> Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2> 
    There are a multitude of file types that appropriate for use on websites ranging from image contains like .png, .jpg, animated images with .gif .mov or the more modern .webm which combines sound with the compression abilities of .gif. There is also html and htm to consider and while they’re both effectively the same thing they can be used in different ways for servers/systems that don’t like a 4 letter file format like .html. 
 </div>    
 <div>   
    <h2> Storing and retrieving files effectively </h2> 
    There are a number of service on the Internet that allow a user to take advantage of cloud storage such as Dropbox (which I personally use!) and others. Generally between services like Dropbox and github maintaining and retrieving files is a trivial issue. 
    Add to your website the following details:

<div>   
    <h2> Preparing appropriate content for your site </h2> 
    Content on myself, the process of creating this website and the information I’ve had to research in-order to build the website haven been tough to sort out but I feel I’ve done a decent enough of a job for my first effort. 
</div>
<div>    
    <h2> Organise and combine information needed for webpages including different platforms </h2> 
    This has been done and prepared for viewing the website on the same browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox on Windows and Mac to ensure the website works as intended in all instances.
</div>
<div>    
   <p> <h2> Select and using appropriate editing and formatting techniques for clarity and good navigation </h2> 
    I’ve made extensive use of [div] to make sure it’ll be easy to distinguish between the different sections of my html code for use with CSS. I’ve also insured that there is a back button that will easily take the user back to index.html.
</p></div>
<div> 
    <h2> Select and use appropriate development techniques to link information across pages </h2> 
    I’ve used both same page jump links, next page hyperlinks with [a id] and [a href]that has helped linked information in the same page to scroll right to it and obviously view a new page with the hyperlinks.
</div>
<div>    
    <h2> Changing file formats for documents if necessary to display on your site </h2> 
    I’ve found that I didn’t need to change too much once I got to this stage. I’ve really only made minor changes like heading and css changes.
</div>
<div>    
   <h2> Error free pages that are fit for purpose </h2> 
    The pages appear to be error free in my testing in multiple browsers. 
</div>
    <p> 
    <h2>Test your site appropriately to make sure it works on different browsers and that everything works as planned - on your GitHub repository for your page include a screen shot of it working in chrome and safari </h2> 
    
    The screenshots (without CSS) have been uploaded to github showing that the website works on several browsers. 
    </p>

    <h2> Identify quality problems and respond to them accordingly </h2> 
    Minor issues with styling have been fixed.
</div>
<div>

    If you’re viewing this then well done! The page is now live on github pages.
</div>
<div>    
    <h2> Respond appropriately to problems in your pages and fix them </h2>
