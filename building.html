<h2> 1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page </h2> 
<p class="custom">is the main landing page of the website which encompasses the basic about me section from unit 1 as well as sources with URL links to the websites to the sources to backup some of points. It also includes a link to the reviews part of the website as per the last part of unit 1. <br>

 <div> 
    <h2> 1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2> 
    <p class="custom">GDPR, DMCA (General Data Protection Regulation, Digital Millennium Copyright Act) are two very important copyright and data protection schemes that all content creators (like myself with Twitch) should be aware of as it will determine how you can handle customer data like cookies and things of that nature. Some websites such as dicks.com (a baseball/American sporting goods website) outright refuses connections from UK IP addresses. </p>
<div>    
    <h2> 1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h2> 
    
    <p class="custom">When talking about disabilities two main issues come to mind; blindness and epilepsy. When it comes to blindness there are certain things that could be taken into account for the degree of the disability such as a colour blind mode, auditory feedback to help the user navigate the website and more. When talking about epilepsy there are two chief things that come to mind that we can do which is first of all warn the user on entry to the website. Finally, having a toggle button that will minimise any flashing effects on the website can help too.</p>
    
    <p class="custom">Naturally there are more disabilities and things we, as developers, can do to help mitigate and ensure the Internet is as open and accessible as possible for everyone. </p>
</div>    
 <div>   
    <h2> 1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites </h2> 
    <p class="custom">There are a multitude of file types that appropriate for use on websites ranging from image contains like .png, .jpg, animated images with .gif .mov or the more modern .webm which combines sound with the compression abilities of .gif. There is also html and htm to consider and while they’re both effectively the same thing they can be used in different ways for servers/systems that don’t like a 4 letter file format like .html. </p>
